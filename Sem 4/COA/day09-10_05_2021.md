3. Fetching a workd from memory 

Move (R1),R2

- Steps
  - MAR <- [R1]
  - Start read operation on the mem bus
  - Wait for the MFC response from the meory
  - Load MDR from the memory bus
  - R2 <- [MDR]

4. Storing a word in memory

- Address is loaded into MAR
- Data to be written loaded into MDR
- Write command is issued 

Move R2,(R1)
- Steps
  - R1 out, MARin
  - R2out, MDRin, write  _MDRE === external_
  - MDR out, WMFC, end _Wait MFC_
