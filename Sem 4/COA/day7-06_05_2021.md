Memory Operation

### Load(/read/Fetch)

memory content doesn't change

registers cant be used

## Instruction and Instruction sequencing
- Data Transfer btw memory and processor

- Arthemetic and logic op on data

- Program sequencing and control

- I/o transger

## Registr transfer Notation
- Identify a location by a symbolic name standing fot its hardware binay addresss
-Name ofor the address of meory location(LOC,PLACE ,A,VAR2..)

- Processor registers names may be(R0,...,R5,...)

-  Contents of a location are denoted by square blackers areound the name of the location
 eg: R1 <- [Loc]
 R3 <- {R1}+{R2}

## Assembly Language notation

Represnt machine instructions and programs

- Move LOC , R1=> R1<-[LOC]

- ADD R1,R2,R3=> R3<-[R1]+[R2]

## Instruction

Instructions contains oPcode and Operend 
eg: Move LOC,R1  - MOVE

opcde can tell the

### Instruction type

### Instruction Execution and straight line sequencing

There r 2 phases of Instruction Execution

### Instruction Execution and branchin

using loop

## Condition Codes

These flags are set to 1 or cleared to 0
