three schema architecture
-----------------------------
1.internal schema
2.conceptual "
3.External Schema

define the capture of a database

1.-
define data storage details, when, what?
access only to database admin or autherised by admin
2.-
access of actual data and the realationship
access to experienced user
3.-
give external view specific to end user

comm b/w external schema and conceptual schema is extenal/conceptual mappint
comm b/w internal schema and conceptual schema is conceptual/internal mappint

data independence
-----------------
abiliity to change the data at a particular level without affecting the other
2 types
-logical data independence
ability to change or modify conceptual schemal without affecting external
level
eg: data retrival and modify
-physical data independence
ability to change or modify internal schemal without affecting conceptual
schema
eg: change file structure, add indexing 

DBMS languages
---------------
data definition lang (ddl)
data manipulation lang (dml): - procedural and non procedural dml

-ddl
to specify conceptual schema
ddl used to define internal and external schemas

some dbms have sotrage definition lang used to define internal
and view definition lang to define external

-Data manipulation lang
to modify data
can be used with high level lang
dml can alternatively be applied as query directly (called a query lang)

types of dml
------------
-procedural/low lvl
mention the query along with position pointer
only retirve one row at a time

-non procedural dml/high lvl
what data to retrive rather than how to retrive it
also called declarative lang
