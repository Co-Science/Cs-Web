## Design Process of a Water Curtain

why?
---
I need a Water Curtain in my home since it looks so cool.

Research of existing idea
---
- the shell is made with metal or plastic which may contain a pipe through which the water flows.
- there should be a water pump to push the water up 
- making a valve that can be controlled gives us more access to how the water flows 

Requirements
---
- Working cost must be low 
- should be sustainabble
- - use recycled water
- made form reused products
- setting up the finished product must not take more than a day
