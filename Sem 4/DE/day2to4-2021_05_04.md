# Engineering Design

Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desire needs.

Design is both a scientific and a creative process.Einstein asserted that imagination is more important than knowlegde

It is a decision- making process , in which the basic sciennces , mathematics , and engineering sciences are applied to optimaly convert resources to meet a stated objective.

## Fundamental Elements

Establishment of objectives and criteriam synthesis, analysis,construction,testingand evaluation anre the fundamental elements of the design process.

If a product is poorly desingde the end product still will be  a bad idea and will ultimately fail, as no one likes to purchase a bad idea.

## Design Process 

### [Lucid air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwzOlPBheO0)

The design process is a sequence of events and a set  of guidelines that helps deine a starting point that takes the designer from visualiizing a product in his imagination to realizing it in the real life in a systematic manner.

the design of a device or a system acan be done in 2 ways:

* Evolutionary change 

* Innovation: Rapid scientific growth and technological discoveries as well as competition among companies fofr thier for thier slice of the market have places a great deal

### Identitying Customer Needs

The need for a new design can be generated from several sources, including the following:

* Client request

* Modigication of an existing design : often a  client asks for a modification of an existing artifact to make it simpler and easy to use.

* Generation of a new product : For an industry to survive in today's world,  it must continue to grow; it cannot afford to remain static.


### Market Aanalysis
Designers must locate what is alreasy available in the market and what they have to offer. Information gathering is a vital task. Design engineers may consult the following sources to determine market availability:

* Teachnical and trade journals

* Abstracts

* Research reports

* Technical libraries

* Catalog og component suppliers 

* US Patent Office

* The internet

### Defining Goals

In this stage of the design process, the designer defines what must be done to resolve 

### Establishing Functions

There is big difference b/w being asked to design a car suspension system and designing a car.It is useful to consiider the level at which the designer is aked to work.

### Specification
This stage requires the  designer to list all pertinent data and parameters that tend to control the design and guide it towards the desired goal; It also sets limits on the acceptable solutions

### Evaluating alternatives
Once a number of concepts have been generated in sufficient detail, a decision must be made about which one or ones will enter the next, most expensive , stages of the design process.

### Embodiment Design
This stage does not include any details yer but will beginto illustrate a clear definition of a part, how it will look, and how it interfaces with the rest of hte parts in the product assembly.

### Analysis and Optimizatiion
Once a possible sol for the stated goal has been 

### Experiment
The experiment stage in engineering seding requires that a piece o fhardware is constructed and tested to verify the concept and analyssi of the design as to its work abilit, durability

3. Prototype : This is the most expensive experimental technique and the one producing the greatest maoutn fo useful information. The prototype is the constructes, full- scale working physical system.

### Marketing 

This stage requires specific info that defines the device, system, or process. Here the designer is required to put his or her thoughts regarding the desing on paper for the purpose
