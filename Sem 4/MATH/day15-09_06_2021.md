A hamiltonian path in a graph G is a path that traverses every vertex of G. Since a Hamiltoninan path is a subgraph of Hamiltonian circuit, evry graph that has a Hamiltonian circuit also has a Hamiltonian path

note: There are many graphs with Hamiltonian paths that have no Hamiltonian circuits.

The length of a Hamiltonian path in a connected graph with n vertices is _n-1_

Theorem: In a complete graph with n vertices there are (n-1)/2 edge - disjoint Hamiltonian circuits , if n is an odd number greater than or equal to 3.

... therfore K5 will have 2 edge-disjoint circuits

Proof:  a complete graph G of n vertices has n(n-1)/2 edges and a Hamiltonian circuit in G consists of n edges. Therefore the number of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian circuits in G cannot exceed (n-1)/2. Now the outer circuit of a complete graph of n vertices is a Hamiltonian circuit. Keeping the vertices fixed on a circle , rotate the polygonal pattern clockwise by 1*360/(n-1) , 2*360/(n-1),..., (n-3)/2 * (360/(n-1)) degrees.  Observe that each rotation produces a Hamiltonian ciucuit that has no edge in common with any of the previous ones.Thus we have (n-3)/2 new Hamiltonian circuits,  all edge disjoint from the first one and also edge disjoint among themselves. Thus all together we haev (n-1)/2 edge disjoint Hamiltonian circuits. hance the theorem
