(n-1)! Hamiltonian circuits are possible for a graph with n vertices

and only (n-1)!/2 distinct Hamiltonian circuits are possible

## Digraph/Directed graph

a directed graph or a digraph G consists of a set of vertices V={v1,v2,...} a set of edges E={e1,e2,...} and a mapping psi that maps every edge onto some ordered pair of vertices (vi,vj). As in the case of undirected graphs, a  vertex is repr by a point and an edge by a line segment between vi and vj with an arrow directed from vi to vj

In a digraph an edge is not only incident on a vertex but is also incident out of a vertex and incident into a vertex. 

The Vertex vi , which edge ek is incident out of , is called the initial vertex of ek.

THe vertex vj, which ek is incident into is called the terminal vertex of ek. 

An edge for which the initial and the final vertices are the same forms a self-loop such as e5.

Two directed edges are said to be parallel if thet are mapped onto the same ordered pair of vertices.

for an edge to be parallel it must also have same direction
