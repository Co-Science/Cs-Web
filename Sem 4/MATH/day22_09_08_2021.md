`Theorem 4`:  A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges

```
Proof:  We prove the theorem by induction

Case n=1

Here tree is an isolated vertex. There are no edges n-1 = 0

Induction step : Assume that theorem holds for all trees with n-1 vertices.
Let G be a tree on n vertices.
Pick any leaf, v let e= vw be its unique edge. 
Remove v and e from G to form H. H is connected and has no cycles S. 
H is a tree with n-1 vertices . By induction hypothesis H has n-2 edges. 
Then G has n-2 +1 = n-1 edges. 
So by induction the theorem is proved
```

`Lemma 5`: Removing an edge from a cycle do not affect the connectivity.

`
Proof:  Pick an edge e= uv from the C in G, 
there are 2 paths P and e between u and v. 
Even if we remove e it is connected.

### Spanning Tree

A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph which is a tree and includes all vertices. (no cycles)

![example of spanning tree](egOfSpanningTree.png)

- A graph G has a spanning tree iff it is connected.
  - if G has a spanning tree, it is connected
  -  If G is connected, then it has a spanning tree

To construct a spanning tree:

- Let G be a connnected graph on n vertices
- if there are any cycle , pick one cylce and remove any edge.
- REpeat until we get a graph without cycles
- If it is still connect and has no cycles , it is a spanning tree.


`Theorem 5`: A connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is a tree

`
Let G be a connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges. Then since G is connected it contains a spanning tree T. G and T have the same vertices. T has n-1 edges which is a subset of the n-1 edges of G. So G and T have the same edges.
G and T have the same vertices and edges. SO G=T. Thus G is a tree.
