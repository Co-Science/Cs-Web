Intro to graaph theory
------

a graph G =(V,E) consists of  a set of objects V ={v1,v2,...} called vertices
 and another set E ={e1,e2,...} ,
 whose elements are called edges ,
 such that each edge e~k~ is identified with an unordered pair (vi,vj) of vertices

The verices vi,vj

An edge having the same vertex as both its end vertices is called a self-loop

more than one edge associated with a given pair of vertices  are referred to as parallel edges

A graph without any self-loop or parallel edged is called simple graph

if the number of veritces is finite its called a finite graph, otherwise its a infinite graph
