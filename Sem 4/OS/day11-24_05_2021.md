## Operations on process
###Process creation
- __parent process__: creating process
- __child process__: new process created
- each of these new process may in turn create other process, forming a tree fo process.
- Process Identifier (PID): an Interger number that provides a unique value for each process in the system.
-PID can be used as an index to access various attributes of a process withing the kernel.

_PPI - parent process identifier_


Parent of all the process is called the _init process_ with pid=1 | serves a the root parent process for all user process

two children of init- _kthreadd_ and _sshd_

kthreadd -> parent of all the kernel process

sshd -> responsible for managing clients that directly log onto the system
