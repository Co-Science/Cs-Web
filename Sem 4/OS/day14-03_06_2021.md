## Fork() in c

`#include <stdio.h>`

`#include <sys/types.h>`

<sys/types.h> can be used for type pid_t for processes ID's as pid_t is defined in <sys/types.h>

> pid_t is a special type for the pid

`#include <unistd.h`

The header file <unistd.h> is where fork() is defined so you have to include it to your program to use fork().

## Case Study: UNIX OS
- A new process is created by the fork() system call.

- Both processes (the parent and the child) continue execution at the instruction after the fork()
- fork() takes no parameters and returns an integer value.
- Below are different values returned by fork()

Successful | Unsuccessful

- Zero : Returned to the newly created child process- Positive value: Returned to parent or caller . The value contains process ID of newly created child process. | - Negative Value:creation of child process was unsuccessful.
 
> no of fork sys calls: 2^(no of fork() )
