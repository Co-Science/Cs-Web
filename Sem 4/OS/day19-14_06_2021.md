## IPC : shared memory
- shared memory is a memory shared between two or more processes
- Steps involved:

1. Create the shared memory segment or use an already created shared memory segment (shmget())

2. Attach the process to the already created shared memory segment (shmat())

3. Detach the process from the already attached shared memory segment (shmdt())

4. Control operations on the shared memory segment (shmctl())

Sys calls realted to shared memory:

ftok(): use to generate a unique key.

stmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg)
